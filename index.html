I am Jeromel Pushparaj, an aspiring full-stack web developer currently <br>
pursuing my B.E. in Computer Science at Dr. Sivanthi Aditanar College of <br>
Engineering. I embarked on my programming journey a few years ago during <br>
the lockdown while I was studying in 10th grade. The web technology <br>
particularly fascinated me, prompting me to give it a try. Now, I am <br>
actively learning and developing projects based on my acquired knowledge. <br>
I derive joy from the process of creating something, as I am the type <br>
who values the journey over the end result. <br>
<br>                
In addition to web development, I have a passion for creating YouTube <br>
videos. One of my beloved hobbies is reading books, with a preference <br>
for non-fiction that encourages positive changes in life, as well as <br>
biographies and autobiographies. I also indulge in thoughtful fictional <br> 
books for entertainment. <br>
<br>                
First and foremost, always remember, Jesus loves you. <br>
